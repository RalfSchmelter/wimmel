The idea is to create an open source hidden object game engine in Java.

Current ideas:
- Make it modular, so people can create games at different levels:
  - A game consists of one or more levels.
  - A level consists of a screen, a set of riddles and a level type.
  - A level type can be something like the normal find type, or spotting
    the difference and so on.
  - A riddle is on object to find, a pair of objects to combine ...
  - A screen is a background and a number of placed objects.
- The backgrounds, objects and screens can be put into libraries, so another
  user can just reuse them.
- Each library has an id and all the objects in that library have a name too.
- Objects from a library are only referenced by the library id plus the object
  id.
- The engine should allow to export a game as a single jar file.
- An applet export might be nice too.
- Maybe we can support Android too?
